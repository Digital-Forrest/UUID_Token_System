# UUID_Token_System
creating and managing UUID for webpage visitors that become leads. Implementing TCPA compliance to help small businesses protect themselves against potential lawsuits. 
This piece of code will create a 36 digit code that will attach it self to the lead upon submission. Along with this code we're pinning down the IP geo.address of the lead so we can tie back the lead to their physical address. We also want to be able to identify the device type used during the submission process.

This will develop more as we continue to build and receive requests to add on.
